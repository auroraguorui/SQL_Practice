-- # 1. Concatenate strings.
--      Concatenation means "stick strings together". In this example we concatenate three strings, name and region are string 
--      attributes of the table, ' is in ' is a string literal.
SELECT CONCAT(name, ' is in ', region)
FROM bbc
WHERE name LIKE 'D%'

-- # 2. Substring: Extracting part of a string.
--      We from position 1 (the beginning) we take two characters. 4.
--      'Afghanistan' -> 'Af'
--      'China'       -> 'Ch'
--      'Sri Lanka'   -> 'Sr'
SELECT name, SUBSTRING(name FROM 1 FOR 2)
FROM bbc

-- # 3. Lower cases. UPPER CASE is similar.
SELECT LOWER(name) FROM bbc
WHERE UPPER(region) = 'SOUTH AMERICA'

-- # 4. Finding a substring in a string. Here we extract the first word of a country name. INSTR gives this position of one string 
--      within another, we use this and substring to pick out the first few characters.
SELECT name,
  POSITION(' ' IN name),
  SUBSTRING(name FROM 1 FOR POSITION(' ' IN name))
FROM bbc
WHERE name LIKE '%Â %'

-- # 5. This rounds up or down
SELECT name, population, ROUND(population/1000000,2), ROUND(population,-6)
FROM bbc
WHERE region='North America'

-- # 6. Replace a NULL with a specific value. The SQL standard is COALESCE
SELECT code, name,
  COALESCE(leader, 'NO LEADER RECORDED!')
FROM party

-- # 7. Conditional values, The SQL Standard is the CASE statement
SELECT title, score,
    CASE WHEN score>8.5 THEN 'Excellent'
        ELSE 'OK'
    END
FROM movie
WHERE 10>id

-- The IF function is also available:
SELECT title, score, IF(score>8.5,'Excellent','OK')
FROM movie

-- # 8. Get the current date and/or time. SQL Standard specifies CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE and CURRENT_TIME.
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME
FROM nix

-- # 9. Format a date and time. Many engines support the SQL standard - see Mimer for details.
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(wk,'%d/%m/%Y'), song
FROM totp
WHERE singer='Tom Jones'

-- # 10. ABS returns the absolute value. The output is positive even if the input is negative:
--       ABS(x) =  x if x >= 0
--       ABS(x) = -x if x <  0
--       ABS can be useful for testing values that are "close". For example this query shows each country that has area that 
--       is roughly 70 thousand. The value 70000 is the target value, 500 is the "tolerance" so the test ABS(area-70000)<500 
--       tests that the area is between 70000-500 and 70000+500. That is 69500 < area < 70500
SELECT name, area 
FROM bbc
WHERE ABS(area-70000) < 500

-- # 11. CAST allows you to convert from one type to another. If you concatenate a string with a number the number will 
--       be automatically changed to a string. However sometimes you need to make the CAST explicit.
--       CAST(expr TO type) 
--       In this example we get the population in millions by casting the floating point value to DECIMAL(8,1) 
--       this ensures one decimal place of accuracy. You can also CAST a date to a string to extract components using SUBSTRING 
--       or make up another date.
SELECT CAST(population/1000000 AS DECIMAL(8,1)) AS a, population/1000000 AS b

-- # 12. CEIL
--       CEIL(f) is ceiling, it returns the integer that is equal to or just more than f
--       CEIL(f) give the integer that is equal to, or just higher than f. CEIL always rounds up.
--       CEIL(2.7)  ->  3
--       CEIL(-2.7) -> -2
--       FLOOR(f) returns the integer value of f
